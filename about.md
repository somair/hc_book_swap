Hi, my name is Joy Chen, and I'm a rising senior at Hinsdale Central High School (class of 2018). This website was created as my final project for Computer Science Topics Honors 2016-2017 
as a more efficient way to trade books with fellow students at HCHS. If you're interested in learning about the technologies used to build HC Book Swap, feel free to check out the pages for
[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) (web framework) and [Skeleton.css](http://getskeleton.com/) (styling boilerplate).

As a student, I'm always looking for more opportunities to learn and grow. You can contact me at 818200@hinsdale86.org.
